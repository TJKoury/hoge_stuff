# Why Develop With Hoge?

There are many ways to develop decentralized apps in the current Ethereum ecosystem.  

Using a token for app utility offers many benefits, and choosing Hoge gives developers some unique advantages.
 
## A few benefits of using a token for app development

- Add cryptographically secure utility without a centralized database to track keys / addresses
- Allows for identifying/interacting with user accounts, without needing personal information
- Enable features for users based on token usage (i.e., holding a certain amount, or for an amount of time)
- Track interactions with other addresses / smart contracts, create innate relational data models
- Use tokens as in-app rewards / payment

## Token Economics: Utility vs. Equity

Some tokens are meant to be used for a specific purpose, locking developers into an ecosystem.  The value of these tokens is usually speculative, changing with the markets perception of the singular use-case or ecosystem.

Others are [securities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/howey-test.asp#:~:text=The%20Howey%20Test%20refers%20to,Securities%20Exchange%20Act%20of%201934), issued by organizations to investors as a way to share in the success of the enterprise.  These are "equity" tokens.  Securities law applies to these, making use by a developer more difficult since compliance (in most countries) with security law is mandatory.  Any legal issues with the organization can affect app developers through no fault of their own.
