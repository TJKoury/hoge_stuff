There are many ways to develop decentralized apps in the current Ethereum ecosystem.  

Using a token for app utility offers many benefits, and choosing Hoge gives developers some unique advantages.
 
## A few benefits of using a token for app development

- Add cryptographically secure app utility without a centralized database to track keys / addresses
- Allows an app to identify/interact with user accounts without needing personal information
- Enable app features for users holding a certain amount of a token, or for a certain amount of time
- Track interactions with other addresses / smart contracts, create innate relational data models
- Use tokens as in-app rewards / payment
